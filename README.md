# GitlabFlow
GitLab Flow is a flexible Git workflow that builds on GitHub Flow while introducing concepts like environment-specific branches (e.g., staging, production) and issue-driven development. It bridges the gap between continuous deployment workflows and versioned release workflows, making it ideal for projects with complex environments.
